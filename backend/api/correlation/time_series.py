Time-series data extraction for correlation analysis.

Extracts time-series data from BigQuery for:
- Entity risk scores (from entity_mentions + events)
- FRED economic indicators (oil price, inflation, GDP, exchange rate)
- Event count aggregates (by type, severity)
"""

# Time-series extraction logic will be integrated into views.py
# This module can be used for future refactoring if needed
