patterns-established:

# Phase 14.1 Plan 04: Data Migration (Skipped) Summary

**Phase 14.1 complete: Data migration skipped per user decision, all code migrated to BigQuery.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-10T03:00:00Z (approximate)
- **Completed:** 2026-01-10T03:02:00Z (approximate)
- **Tasks:** 0 (all skipped)
- **Files modified:** 0

## Accomplishments

- Evaluated migration requirements and determined historical data migration not needed
- Confirmed all application code successfully migrated to BigQuery (plans 01-03)
- Documented decision to skip data migration
- Identified future optimization opportunity: GDELT native BigQuery dataset
- Phase 14.1 marked complete

## Task Commits

No tasks executed - plan skipped per user decision.

## Files Created/Modified

None - no code changes required.

## Decisions Made

- **Data migration not required** - Historical PostgreSQL Event/EntityMention data does not need to be migrated to BigQuery. The system is fully operational with new data flowing to BigQuery.

- **Code migration sufficient** - Plans 14.1-01, 14.1-02, and 14.1-03 successfully updated:
  - BigQuery infrastructure and service layer (plan 01)
  - All Celery ingestion tasks writing to BigQuery (plan 02)
  - All API endpoints and chat tools querying BigQuery (plan 03)

- **PostgreSQL models remain** - Event and EntityMention models in PostgreSQL not deprecated. Keeping them provides:
  - Rollback capability if BigQuery issues arise
  - No risk since they're no longer being written to (as of plan 02)
  - Clean removal possible in future if needed

- **Future GDELT optimization** - User identified GDELT native BigQuery dataset (`gdelt-bq.gdeltv2`) as optimization opportunity. This would eliminate custom GDELT API polling and ingestion. Deferred to future phase.

## Deviations from Plan

**Entire plan skipped** - The original 14.1-04-PLAN.md specified 4 tasks:
1. Create data migration management command
2. Execute data migration and validate
3. Deprecate PostgreSQL Event/EntityMention models
4. Update deployment configuration

All tasks skipped because:
- Historical data migration not needed for system operation
- All new data flows to BigQuery (Celery tasks updated in plan 02)
- All read paths query BigQuery (API/chat updated in plan 03)
- PostgreSQL data can remain for rollback safety
- Future GDELT optimization will replace custom ingestion anyway

## Issues Encountered

None

## Next Phase Readiness

✓ Phase 14.1 complete (all plans 01-04 finished)
✓ All BigQuery infrastructure operational (dataset, tables, partitioning)
✓ All Celery tasks write to BigQuery (GDELT, ReliefWeb, FRED, UN Comtrade, World Bank)
✓ All API endpoints query BigQuery (events, entities, trending, risk, chat)
✓ PostgreSQL Event/EntityMention models remain for rollback safety
✓ System fully operational with polyglot persistence architecture

**Phase 14.1 Migration Complete:**
- TimescaleDB limitation worked around via BigQuery
- Polyglot persistence: PostgreSQL (reference data) + BigQuery (time-series data)
- Redis trending deprecated (BigQuery handles it)
- Production-ready for deployment

**Future Optimization Opportunity:**
- Migrate to GDELT native BigQuery dataset (`gdelt-bq.gdeltv2`)
- Eliminate custom GDELT API polling and ingestion
- Reduce infrastructure complexity
- Consider for future phase or milestone

**Ready for Phase 15:** Time-series forecasting with Vertex AI (per original v1.2 roadmap)
