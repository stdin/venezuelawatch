# Phase 8: Design System Foundation - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-09
**Status:** Ready for research

<vision>
## How This Should Work

The design system should feel modern and accessible - contemporary design with strong emphasis on readability and accessibility. This isn't about being flashy or corporate; it's about creating a foundation that makes risk intelligence clear and usable for everyone.

The system needs to balance data clarity, visual hierarchy, and inclusive design equally. When users look at VenezuelaWatch, they should immediately understand what's important through clear typographic hierarchy and risk-aware colors that communicate meaning instantly.

The deliverable is an interactive style guide (like Storybook) that shows all design tokens in use - not just documentation, but a living reference that demonstrates how the system works.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Typography Scale** - Clear size hierarchy that distinguishes headlines, body text, captions, and metadata. This is the foundation that makes scanning risk data effortless. If we only get one thing right, it's this.
- **Risk-First Color System** - Colors serve primarily to communicate risk levels (red/yellow/green with semantic meaning). Risk awareness drives color choices, not branding.
- **Modern & Accessible Foundation** - Contemporary design patterns with readability and accessibility built in from the start, not added later.

## What's Out of Scope

- Component implementation - This phase establishes tokens and system, Phase 9 builds actual buttons/inputs/cards
- Page redesigns - Don't apply to existing Dashboard/Entities/Chat pages yet, just establish the foundation
- Animation/Motion - No transitions or micro-interactions, focus on static design fundamentals
- Custom illustrations/icons - Typography and color first, visual assets later
- Brand identity work - Not establishing brand colors or logo, focused on functional design system

</boundaries>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Deliverable format: Interactive style guide (Storybook-style) that shows all tokens in use
- Typography focus: Size hierarchy is the critical success factor for data scanning
- Color approach: Risk-first palette where colors communicate risk levels as their primary function
- Open to standard approaches for technical implementation (CSS variables, design tokens format, etc.)

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

User emphasized that all three aspects (data clarity, visual hierarchy, inclusive design) are equally important for the overall vision, but if forced to prioritize ONE thing for this phase specifically, it's the typography scale and size hierarchy.

The risk-first color approach reflects the product's core value: risk intelligence. Colors aren't decorative, they're semantic and communicate meaning.

No specific design system references or technical preferences mentioned - open to industry-standard approaches that work well.
