**Tech stack available:**
- Storybook 10 with @storybook/addon-a11y configured
- Mantine UI with custom breakpoints
- React 19.2 + TypeScript

**Established patterns:**
- Phase 13-01: Custom breakpoints (xs: 576px through xl: 1408px)
- Phase 13-01: Storybook a11y with test: 'error' mode
- Phase 13-01: Skip links and ARIA landmarks
- Phase 13-02: Dashboard responsive and keyboard accessible
- Phase 13-03: Entities and Chat responsive and keyboard accessible

**Constraining decisions:**
- All previous phases: Design system, components, and patterns must be maintained
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance required (no exceptions)
- Documentation should be developer-friendly with code examples

**Research findings:**
- Storybook a11y uses axe-core for automated checks
- Common violations: missing labels, color contrast, keyboard traps
- Documentation should cover when to use useMediaQuery vs responsive props
- ARIA patterns documented for forms, navigation, loading states, tables

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Run Storybook a11y audit and fix violations</name>
  <files>frontend/src/**/*.tsx</files>
  <action>Run npm run storybook and systematically check all component stories for a11y violations in the Accessibility tab. Document violations found in each story. Fix violations by priority: 1) Critical violations (missing labels, keyboard traps, color contrast failures), 2) Serious violations (improper ARIA usage, missing roles), 3) Moderate violations (best practice improvements). Common fixes: add aria-label to unlabeled buttons/icons, ensure form inputs have labels, add alt text to images, fix color contrast ratios, ensure focus visible. For Dashboard/Entities/Chat pages, create or update stories if they don't exist. If any components can't be fixed immediately (e.g., third-party components), use a11y config to set test: 'todo' for those specific stories and document the issue. Re-run checks until all stories pass or have documented exceptions.</action>
  <verify>npm run storybook shows all stories with a11y tab passing (green checkmarks), any 'todo' stories documented with reason, no critical or serious violations remaining</verify>
  <done>Storybook a11y checks passing or documented for all stories, violations fixed with commits, test: 'todo' only used for documented WIP items</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create responsive design documentation</name>
  <files>frontend/docs/responsive-design.md</files>
  <action>Create frontend/docs/ directory if it doesn't exist. Write frontend/docs/responsive-design.md documenting Phase 13 responsive patterns. Include: 1) Breakpoints section: document custom breakpoints (xs: 576px, sm: 768px, md: 992px, lg: 1200px, xl: 1408px) and when to use each. 2) Utilities section: useMediaQuery vs useMatches vs responsive props - when to use each, code examples. 3) Grid patterns: demonstrate responsive Grid.Col with span={{ base, md, lg }} syntax. 4) Component examples: show Dashboard 2-column layout, Entities split-view, Chat center-focused with code snippets. 5) Mobile-first approach: explain base → md → lg progression. 6) Testing section: how to test responsive at different breakpoints, browser dev tools, actual devices. 7) Common patterns: Stack gap responsive, Typography size responsive, Container fluid vs fixed. Use markdown with code blocks, keep practical and example-driven.</action>

  <action>Write frontend/docs/accessibility.md documenting Phase 13 accessibility patterns.

Include code examples from actual Dashboard/Entities/Chat implementation. Reference research findings for ARIA best practices.</action>

       - Entities stories - all passing
       - Chat stories - all passing
       - Component stories - passing or documented as 'todo'
       - No critical or serious violations remaining
    3. Review documentation:
       - Open frontend/docs/responsive-design.md
       - Verify breakpoints documented
       - Verify utilities explained with examples

       - Open frontend/docs/accessibility.md
       - Verify ARIA patterns documented
       - Verify keyboard nav explained

# Phase 13 Plan 4: Accessibility Verification & Documentation Summary

**[Substantive one-liner - what shipped]**

## Accomplishments

- Storybook a11y checks passing for all component stories
- [N] accessibility violations fixed across Dashboard, Entities, and Chat pages
- Comprehensive responsive design guide created (frontend/docs/responsive-design.md)
- Comprehensive accessibility guide created (frontend/docs/accessibility.md)
- **Phase 13 complete:** All pages responsive and accessible, WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- v1.1 UI/UX Overhaul milestone complete

## Files Created/Modified

- `frontend/src/**/*.tsx` - Fixed a11y violations (list specific files with issues)
- `frontend/docs/responsive-design.md` - Created with breakpoints, utilities, patterns
- `frontend/docs/accessibility.md` - Created with ARIA patterns, keyboard nav, testing
- `.storybook/preview.tsx` - Verified a11y configuration

## Decisions Made

**Documentation format:** Created markdown guides in frontend/docs/ for developer accessibility, not external user docs.

**Test mode:** Kept Storybook a11y test: 'error' mode for strict enforcement, used test: 'todo' sparingly for documented WIP items only.

## Issues Encountered

[List any violations found and how they were fixed, or "None"]

## Next Phase Readiness

**Phase 13 Complete** - VenezuelaWatch is now fully responsive (320px-1440px+) and accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant). All three pages (Dashboard, Entities, Chat) work on mobile devices with touch-friendly interfaces. Keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, and screen reader support implemented throughout. Storybook a11y checks enforce accessibility standards. Documentation provides team with responsive design and accessibility patterns for future development.

**v1.1 UI/UX Overhaul Complete** - Comprehensive redesign finished with design system (Phase 8), component library (Phase 9), redesigned Dashboard (Phase 10), Entities (Phase 11), Chat (Phase 12), and responsive/accessible implementation (Phase 13).

Ready for: Production deployment or v1.2 feature development
